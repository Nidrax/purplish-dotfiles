# Purplish theme dotfiles

This theme is based on [Keyitdev configuration](https://github.com/Keyitdev/dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file). You might want to check it out first before applying dotfiles listed here.

Shout-out to [zawadahmed33](https://github.com/zawadahmed33) for his [Brown-ish polybar theme](https://github.com/zawadahmed33/Brown-ish) I used as a base.
